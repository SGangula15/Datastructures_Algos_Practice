# Datastructures and Algorithms
Interview prep and practice

Place holder to keep track of practice problems covered

1. Fibonacci Optimised @ T=O(n), S=O(1)
2. Kadane's - Find Maxsum of continous subarray @ T=O(n), S=O(1)
3. Majority Element with T=O(n), S=O(n) and with Boyer-Moore method @ T=O(n), S=O(1)

4. First unique elemenr, uisng hashmap @ T=O(n), S=O(N)

T = Time complexity
S = Space complexity
